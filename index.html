        <p>I've always wanted to visit Los Angeles, friends are always recomending me to check it out for all the events that go on over there. Chicago is popular for it's music so i'm interested in checking them out as well. Lastly, Philly has the stairs from Rocky, who wouldn't want to check that out.</p>
